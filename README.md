# Number-Translator

A versatile Python program to convert numbers into their word representations and vice versa. Perfect for educational purposes, data processing, or any application requiring number-to-text conversion.

## Introduction

The Number-Translator is a Python program that allows users to:

- Convert numeric values (e.g., 123) into their word representations (e.g., "one hundred twenty-three").
- Convert word representations of numbers (e.g., "two million") into their numeric equivalents (e.g., 2000000).

This tool is designed to handle large numbers (up to billions) and is case-insensitive. It also includes robust error handling to ensure accurate conversions.

## Features

### • Bidirectional Conversion:

- Convert numbers to words (e.g., 34500 → "thirty-four thousand five hundred").
- Convert words to numbers (e.g., "one million two hundred" → 1000200).

### • Large Number Support:

- Handles numbers up to billions (e.g., 1,000,000,000).

### • Error Handling:

- Detects invalid inputs (e.g., misspelled words or non-numeric strings).

### • User-Friendly Interface:

- Interactive menu for easy navigation.

### • Case-Insensitive:

- Accepts input in any case (e.g., "ONE HUNDRED" or "one hundred").
